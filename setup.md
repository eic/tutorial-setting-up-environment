> Note: If you are using the [BNL SDCC](https://eic.github.io/tutorial-setting-up-environment/BNL_SDCC_QuickStart/index.html)or the [JLab Farm](https://eic.github.io/tutorial-setting-up-environment/JLAB_Farm_QuickStart/index.html), you may find the quick start info in the extras section useful if you are new to these systems.

In advance of the training session, please ensure that
1. You have a GitHub account ([sign up here](https://github.com/signup))
1. Your GitHub account is a member of the [EIC organization](https://github.com/eic) on GitHub
- Email [the EIC software conveners](mailto:eic-software-l-request@lists.bnl.gov) with your GitHub account to be added
1. You have singularity/apptainer or docker (on Mac) installed and working
- Provided by default on BNL SDCC and the JLab iFarm, check by trying the command `singularity` and verify that you get an info dump on the usage of the command
- On your local system:
  - systems that use cvmfs or download images can install **singularity or apptainer** (see [here](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/quick_start.html))
  - systems that download images can install **docker** (see [here](https://www.docker.com/))
- You should at a minimum be able to run either of the following commands and open a shell:
  - `singularity run docker://alpine`
  - `docker run --rm -it alpine`
1. Download `eic-shell`:
- Due to time and bandwidth limitations, this should be downloaded to your desired system before the live tutorial
- From the system you use with singularity/apptainer or docker, make a folder called `eic`
- From inside this directory:
  - Install by running the command:
```
curl --location https://get.epic-eic.org | bash
```
  - **or** you can save the file at https://get.epic-eic.org as `install.sh` and run this script by hand:
```
wget --output-document install.sh https://get.epic-eic.org
bash install.sh
```
