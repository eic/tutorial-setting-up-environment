title: Setup
---
In advance of the training session, please ensure that
1. You have a GitHub account ([sign up here](https://github.com/signup))
1. Your GitHub account is a member of the [EIC organization](https://github.com/eic) on GitHub
- Email [the EICUG SWG conveners](mailto:eic-software-l-owner@lists.bnl.gov) with your GitHub account to be added
1. You have singularity/apptainer or docker (on Mac) installed and working
- `module load singularity` (on most JLab or BNL systems) (preferred option)
- Local system options:
  - systems that use cvmfs or download images can install **singularity or apptainer** (see [here](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/quick_start.html))
  - systems that download images can install **docker** (see [here](https://www.docker.com/))
- you should at a minimum be able to run either of the following commands and open a shell:
  - `singularity run docker://alpine`
  - `docker run --rm -it alpine`
1. Download `eic-shell`:
- Due to time and bandwidth limitations, this should be downloaded to your desired system before the live tutorial
- From the system you use with singularity/apptainer or docker, make a folder called `eic`
- From inside this directory:
  - Install by running the command:
```
curl --location https://get.epic-eic.org | bash
```
  - **or** you can save the file at https://get.epic-eic.org as `install.sh` and run this script by hand:
```
wget --output-document install.sh https://get.epic-eic.org
bash install.sh
```
