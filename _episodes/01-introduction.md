In this episode we will cover two aspects of the EIC Software Environment:
- the actual commands you can run to access the software components we rely on for simulations and analysis,
- the services and repositories you will want to contribute to in order to work collaboratively.

Much of the work we do at the EIC relies on both of these collaborative environments.
